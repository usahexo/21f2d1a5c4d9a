#  Quebec Casinos Twin Down on Blackjack to Cut Costs

Quebec casinos twin down on blackjack to cut costs, as reported by CBC News. Casino du Lac-Leamy and Casino de Mont-Tremblant have both removed the game from their floors in recent months.

While a spokesperson for Quebec's gambling authority, has said the move is simply to "optimize" the gaming experience for customers, it's likely that cost-cutting is also a factor. Blackjack is known to be one of the most expensive games in terms of house edge for casinos.

Casinos are under pressure to cut costs as government revenues decline. This follows a trend across Canada of austerity measures being brought in by provincial governments in an effort to get budgets back in balance.

#  Ontario Gambling Watchdog Supports Quebec Casino Decision to Twin Down on Blackjack

A spokesperson for the Ontario Gambling watchdog has come out in support of the recent Quebec casino decision to twin down on blackjack.

The spokesperson said that the decision is a sound one, as it will help to keep players safe and protect the casinosâ€™ bottom line.

He added that the Ontario Gambling watchdog will be keeping a close eye on how the new policy is implemented, and if necessary, it may recommend similar measures for casinos in Ontario.

#  Manitoba and Saskatchewan Casinos not Planning to Twin Down on Blackjack

The province of Manitoba and Saskatchewan casinos will not be twinning down on blackjack anytime soon. This was confirmed by both the Manitoba Liquor & Lotteries Corporation (MBLL) as well as the Saskatchewan Gaming Corporation (SGC).

The move comes after a number of industry insiders argued that the two provinces could see big benefits by pooling their resources and offering the same games at each casino. However, it seems that this is not something either government is interested in at this time.

According to a spokesperson for MBLL, the corporation is always looking at ways to improve its offerings for customers but it has no plans to twin down on blackjack with Saskatchewan at this time.

A spokesperson for SGC echoed those comments, saying that while the gaming corporation is always looking at ways to improve the customer experience, there are no plans to twin down on blackjack with Manitoba at this time.

This news may come as a disappointment to some players who were hoping to see similar games being offered at each casino but it looks like they will have to continue travelling if they want to enjoy that particular game.

#  Alberta and British Columbia Casinos Still Offering Full-Pay Blackjack

A recent study by gaming experts at the University of Alberta found that casinos in Alberta and British Columbia are still offering full-pay blackjack games, which return a player 96.3% of their bets. Contrast that with Las Vegas, where the average casino offers blackjack with a house edge of 2.5%, and it's easy to see why many Canadian gamblers are flocking to these two provinces.

The study also found that the casinos in Alberta and British Columbia offer a variety of other high-payout games, including roulette (99%), craps (99.4%), baccarat (99.6%), and three-card poker (98.7%). In addition, the casinos offer excellent comps and other benefits to players, such as free hotel rooms, meals, and show tickets. So if you're looking for some great gambling action, be sure to check out the casinos in Alberta and British Columbia!

#  Atlantic Canada Casinos yet to Make a Decision on Twinning down on Blackjack

The Atlantic provinces have been discussing the idea of Twinning down on Blackjack, but there has been no decision yet made.

Under this proposed new rule, players would be allowed to double down on any two cards, including aces. This would be an increase from the current rule, which allows doubling down only on a hand totaling 10 or 11.

Some casinos in Atlantic Canada are in favour of the change, while others are undecided. Those in favour of the change say it would make the game more exciting for players and could lead to increased profits.

However, those against the change argue that it would lead to increased losses for casinos. They point out that a player who doubles down on a hand of two eights has only a 44% chance of winning, while a player who doubles down on a hand of two kings has a 97% chance of winning.

So far, no decision has been made on whether or not to implement Twinning down on Blackjack in Atlantic Canada.
