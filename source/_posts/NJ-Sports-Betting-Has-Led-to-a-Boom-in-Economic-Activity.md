#  NJ Sports Betting Has Led to a Boom in Economic Activity

As the state with the most active sports betting market in the country, New Jersey has seen a significant uptick in economic activity since legalizing the activity in June of 2018. According to a report by Moody’s Analytics, NJ sports betting has led to a $1.3 billion increase in economic activity, and created more than 4,000 jobs. This is good news for a state that has been struggling economically in recent years.

The report also found that legalized sports betting is generating tax revenue for the state government. In the first eight months of operation, NJ sports betting generated over $38 million in taxes. This is money that can be used to fund important programs and services in the state.

It is clear that NJ sports betting is benefitting the state economy in a number of ways. Not only is it creating jobs and generating tax revenue, but it is also attracting tourists who are spending money at local businesses. This is great news for New Jersey and shows that legalized sports betting can be a valuable contributor to the economy.

#  NJ Sports Betting Has Helped Generate Millions in Tax Revenue

The legalization of sports betting in NJ has generated millions of dollars in tax revenue for the state since it was legalized in June 2018.

One report by Econsult found that New Jersey’s gambling industry generated $248 million in gross gaming revenue in the second quarter of 2019. This is an increase from the $213 million generated in the same quarter of 2018, prior to the legalization of sports betting.

Most of this revenue came from casino gambling, but sports betting also contributed to the growth. The state’s Division of Gaming Enforcement reported that New Jersey raked in $24.2 million in sports bets in July 2019. This was an increase from the $17.8 million collected in July 2018.

The money generated from taxes on gambling has been used to fund various government programs and services. In Fiscal Year 2020, which started on July 1, 2019, New Jersey allocated $40 million of its tax revenue from gambling to its budget for public schools. This is an increase from the $26 million allocated for public schools in Fiscal Year 2019.

Gambling has also helped to create jobs and support businesses throughout the state. There are now more than 2,000 people employed by New Jersey’s gaming industry, and this number is expected to grow as more casinos open up shop. In addition, businesses such as restaurants and hotels have seen a boost thanks to increased tourism from gamblers.

The legalization of sports betting has been a big success for New Jersey and has helped to generate millions of dollars in tax revenue for the state. This money has been used to fund important government programs and services, and it has also created jobs and supported businesses throughout the state.

#  NJ Residents Spend More than $1 Billion on Illegal Sports Gambling

In New Jersey, residents spent more than $1 billion on illegal sports gambling in 2017, according to a recent study by the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

The study found that New Jersey residents wagered an estimated $2.7 billion on sports from March 2017 to February 2018, $1.24 billion of which was bet illegally. Of that amount, only about $269 million was wagered through legal channels such as casinos and race tracks.

“These findings underscore that there is a large demand for unlicensed sports betting in New Jersey and that it is not being met by licensed venues,” said study author Donald Luskin.

The study also found that illegal sports betting was most popular among men aged 18 to 34, with nearly 60 percent of all wagers placed by this group. African-American and Latino residents were also more likely to place bets illegally than other groups.

While the state has made some efforts to legalize and regulate sports betting, including a failed attempt in 2017, current law prohibits most forms of gambling aside from the lottery and casino games. This leaves the majority of sports betting in New Jersey taking place illegally.

Casinos and racetracks have been pushing for years to change the law, arguing that legalization would bring much needed revenue to the state. A recent poll found that 66 percent of New Jersey voters support legalizing and regulating sports betting.

While the future of sports betting in New Jersey is uncertain, one thing is clear: NJ residents are spending a lot of money on illegal wagers.

#  NJ Sports Betting Could Help Revive Struggling Atlantic City Casinos

Atlantic City officials are looking into the possibility of allowing sports betting in an effort to revive the city’s struggling casinos.

Nine casinos have closed in Atlantic City since 2014, leaving thousands of people out of work. The city has been struggling to find a new identity and attract tourism dollars.

Sports betting could help turn things around for the city’s casinos. A study by Oxford Economics found that if sports betting were legalized in New Jersey, it would generate over $1 billion in economic activity and create over 8,000 jobs.

Atlantic City is not the only place where sports betting could help revive a struggling casino industry. In Las Vegas, casino income has been declining in recent years due to competition from new resorts in other states. Legalizing sports betting could help reinvigorate the Las Vegas casino industry.

Some people oppose legalizing sports betting, arguing that it will increase gambling addiction and crime rates. However, there is no evidence that legalizing sports betting leads to increased crime rates or addiction levels. In fact, many experts believe that legalization could actually help reduce addiction levels by providing a safer and more regulated way to bet on sports.

So far, only five states have legalized sports betting: Delaware, Nevada, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. More states are likely to follow suit as the legality of sports betting is debated in courts across the country.
