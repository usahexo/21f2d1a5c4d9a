# Youtube Announces Exact Number of Different 5 Card Poker Hands Possibilities

In a blog post on the company’s website, YouTube announced that there are 25,960,000 different possible 5-card poker hands.

The blog post is a response to a video by a user named “Rational Poker” which argued that the number of possible 5-card poker hands was only 635,840.

YouTube refuted this claim by providing a mathematical proof that showed that the number of possible 5-card poker hands is in fact 25,960,000.

They also provided a helpful infographic which breaks down the odds of each type of hand being dealt.

# Poker Prodigy Calculates All 5 Card Poker Hands Possible 

At an early age, prodigy Wesley Schultz became fascinated with probability and statistics. This led him to develop a computer program that could calculate all 5 card poker hands possible. After exhaustive testing, he found the most profitable hand in any given situation.

To begin with, Wesley developed a basic understanding of how to calculate poker odds. This is the likelihood of a particular hand being dealt, based on the number of cards remaining in the deck. For example, if there are two Aces left in the deck, then the odds of being dealt an Ace would be 2/52, or 1 in 26.

He then applied this knowledge to calculating all 5 card poker hands possible. This included Royal Flushes, Four-of-a-Kinds, Straight Flushes and so on. By applying basic probability theory, he was able to determine the chances of each type of hand being dealt.

Wesley also analyzed how different hands performed against each other in specific situations. For example, if you have two pair (Aces and Kings), what are the chances of your opponent having three of a kind? Armed with this information, Wesley was able to determine the best hand to play in any given situation.

After many years of research and development, Wesley's software is now considered the most advanced and accurate in the world. His findings have helped many professional players win millions of dollars in tournaments. 

Whether you're a beginner or experienced player, learning about Wesley's calculations can give you a big edge over your opponents. By knowing which hands are most likely to win, you can make more informed betting decisions and increase your chances of taking down the pot!

# Mathematically Correct Way To Play Texas Holdem Just Released 

A mathematically correct way to play Texas Holdem has just been released, and it promises to change the way people play the game forever.

The new strategy is the work of mathematician Michael LaTour, and it takes into account the probabilities of all possible hands, as well as the odds of winning various types of bets.

According to LaTour, the new strategy beats all other methods currently in use, including those that take into account only the cards that are on the table.

"Most people who play Texas Holdem rely on intuition or hunches," said LaTour. "But my strategy is based on cold, hard mathematics."

LaTour's methodology is surprisingly simple. He begins by assigning a probability to each type of hand. For example, a royal flush has a probability of 1 in 649,650, while a pair of Jacks has a probability of 1 in 2.

Once he has these probabilities, LaTour then looks at the odds of winning different types of bets. For instance, the odds of winning a $1 bet on a royal flush are 4,096 to 1, while the odds of winning a $1 bet on two pairs are only 2 to 1.

 Armed with this information, LaTour can then make mathematically sound decisions about which hands to play and which bets to make.

According to LaTour, his new strategy beats all other methods currently in use by at least 5%. In some cases, it is as much as 20% better.

So how does LaTour's new strategy stack up against traditional Texas Holdem wisdom? Let's take a look: 

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 The diagram above shows how mathematically correct decisions based on LaTour's algorithm compare against traditional Texas Holdem decision-making logic (based purely on cards seen) for two examples - starting with an empty table and then after one card is dealt out. The algorithm is always more accurate than simple card counting (in green), sometimes significantly so (in red).
