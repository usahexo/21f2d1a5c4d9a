#  What recourse does a new gambling site have against a new chargeback?

When a new site starts up, it's inevitable that there will be chargebacks. This is simply because customers who have never used the site before do not yet know whether or not they can trust it. Depending on the size and financial stability of the new site, chargebacks can range from a minor nuisance to a crippling financial blow.

In order to mitigate the risk of chargebacks, many new sites institute a policy that forbids any customer who has previously initiated a chargeback from using the site in the future. This can be an effective safeguard against future chargebacks, but it can also lead to cancellation of legitimate orders and loss of revenue.

What recourse does a new gambling site have against this type of chargeback? Unfortunately, not much. The best course of action is usually to contact the customer who initiated the chargeback and try to get them to rescind their claim. If that fails, then the site may be able to pursue legal action, but this is often costly and time-consuming. Ultimately, it's up to the site owner to decide how much risk they're willing to take in order to protect their business.

#  Website owners concerned about chargebacks

A recent study by LexisNexis has found that almost 60% of website owners are concerned about chargebacks, which can often be a drain on profits and resources.

Chargebacks occur when a customer disputes a charge with their credit card company, and the credit card company sides with the customer. This can happen for a number of reasons, such as a product not arriving, the product being different than what was ordered, or the product being defective.

When a chargeback happens, the website owner is forced to reimburse the credit card company for the purchase, as well as any associated fees. This can be a significant amount of money, especially for small businesses.

In order to avoid chargebacks, website owners should take steps to ensure that their customers are happy with their purchase. This includes shipping products quickly and accurately, providing clear descriptions of products, and resolving any complaints quickly and effectively.

If you are a website owner concerned about chargebacks, there are a number of steps you can take to protect yourself and your business. By following these tips, you can minimize your risk of chargebacks and protect your profits.

#  Gambling site launches in face of increasing chargebacks

Amidst concerns over increasing chargebacks and fraudulent activities, a new gambling site has announced its launch. The site, which is unnamed, plans to offer a variety of games to its users, including poker, blackjack, and slots.

The site's operators say that they have put in place a number of measures to deter fraud and protect customers. These include multi-level authentication measures as well as limits on how much money individual players can withdraw at any given time.

In a statement, the site's spokesperson said: "We believe that our platform offers a fair and safe experience for all of our players. We have put in place a number of measures to deter fraud and protect our customers' information."

The site is expected to go live in the next few weeks.

#  Online gambling site files lawsuit against card companies

Casino.com, an online gambling site, has filed a lawsuit against American Express, Mastercard and Visa. The casino alleges that the card companies have been working together to block payments to online gambling sites.

The lawsuit was filed in the US District Court for the District of Columbia. Casino.com is seeking an injunction that would prohibit the card companies from blocking payments to online gambling sites, as well as damages in excess of $150 million.

"This is a dispute between our company and the credit card companies," said a spokesperson for Casino.com. "We are asking the court to ensure that our customers can continue using their credit cards to make payments to our site."

The card companies have not yet commented on the lawsuit.

#  Site owner considering closing doors after spate of chargebacks

In the past month, the site owner has had to deal with an unusual number of chargebacks. This, combined with the other expenses of running the business, has led them to consider closure as the only option.

The site, which is a small ecommerce business, has been in operation for over five years. The current owner took it over two years ago, and since then, has worked tirelessly to make it a success. In that time, they’ve weathered several storms; including changes in Google’s search algorithm that have adversely affected traffic to the site. But this latest issue – dealing with so many chargebacks – is one they feel they can’t overcome.

When the site first started experiencing chargebacks, the owner reached out to their credit card processing company for help. Unfortunately, there wasn’t much that could be done. The credit card company explained that while they sympathize with the situation, they can only protect merchants against fraudulent transactions – not those that are simply disputed by buyers.

In response to the chargebacks, the owner put several measures in place to try and prevent them from happening again. They increased the security on their site, updated their return policy, and reached out to their customer base to educate them on how to dispute a charge if they felt they had been wronged. But even with all of these precautions, chargebacks continued to roll in at an alarming rate.

Ultimately, this spate of chargebacks has led the owner to consider closing up shop permanently. They’ve already begun telling their employees that they will be let go come January and are actively looking for a buyer for the business. If no one comes forward in the next few weeks, they will be forced to shutter their doors for good.
