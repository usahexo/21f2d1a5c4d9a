There’s no question that 2017 was an incredible year for gaming, with blockbusters like “Horizon Zero Dawn” and “Super Mario Odyssey” captivating players around the world. But if there’s one game that’s been generating the most buzz lately, it’s undoubtedly Fox 2’s Hot Game of the Year: “Fortnite.”

Developed by Epic Games, “Fortnite Battle Royale” is a free-to-play online shooter that has taken the gaming world by storm. In it, 100 players are dropped onto an island where they must fight to the death until only one player is left standing. What makes “Fortnite” so unique is its building mechanic, which allows players to construct fortresses and other structures to protect themselves from enemy fire.

But what makes “Fortnite” so addicting? Well, part of it may be its cartoonish visuals and playful aesthetic, which is a far cry from the realistic graphics of games like “Call of Duty.” Another reason is its fast-paced action, which keeps players on their toes and constantly on the move.
