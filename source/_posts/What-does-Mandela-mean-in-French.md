#  What does Mandela mean in French?

Mandela is a name that is derived from two African languages: Kiswahili and Zulu. The name Mandela means "troublemaker" in Kiswahili, and "to make something difficult" in Zulu.

Interestingly, the Nelson Mandela Foundation has stated that the name Nelson was not given to him by his parents, but rather by a teacher at his school. At the time, Nelson was one of many boys who were given names which started with N (the letter N was popular at the time), such as Neville and Nigel.

#  Mandela: A Symbol of Freedom and Equality

On July 18, 1918, Nelson Mandela was born in the small village of Mvezo in the Transkei region of South Africa. He was born to a royal family; his father, Chief Gadla Henry Mphakanyiswa, was a counselor to the king of the Thembu people. Mandela spent his early childhood living an idyllic life on the family’s cattle farm. However, this changed in 1942 when he was forced to leave home and attend a boarding school in Johannesburg.

Mandela completed high school and then enrolled at the University of Witwatersrand, where he studied law. In 1944, he joined the African National Congress (ANC), an organization working for racial equality in South Africa. Mandela quickly rose through the ranks of the ANC, becoming one of its leading members. In 1956, he was arrested for treason and sabotage for his part in planning peaceful protests against apartheid – a brutal system of segregation that relegated black South Africans to second-class status.

After spending 27 years in prison – much of it spent on Robben Island, an isolated island off Cape Town – Mandela was finally released in 1990. He immediately went back to work campaigning for racial equality, and in 1994 became the first black president of South Africa. As president, Mandela worked tirelessly to promote national reconciliation and build a more equitable society. His efforts earned him numerous awards, including the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993.

Nelson Mandela passed away on December 5th, 2013 at the age of 95. He is remembered as one of history’s most influential figures in the fight for racial equality and democracy worldwide.
