#  License Revoked for Illegal Cyber Gambling Operator

The Malta Gaming Authority has announced that it has revoked the license of an illegal cyber gambling operator.

The MGA said in a statement that it had decided to revoke the license of the operator due to its "flagrant and continued disregard of Maltese law" relating to online gambling.

The MGA also said that it had terminated the contract of the company's CEO and barred him from holding any future management or operational roles in the gaming industry.

This is not the first time that the MGA has acted against an illegal gambling operator. Late last year, it revoked the license of another operator that was found to be operating without a permit.

 Maltese authorities are determined to crack down on unlicensed operators, and players are urged to be vigilant when choosing an online casino. Only licensed operators can ensure that players are protected by consumer protection laws and are playing in a safe and fair environment.

#  Biggest Cyber Gambling Scandal in History Unveiled

On Wednesday, the 14th of February, 2018, the biggest cyber gambling scandal in history was unveiled. The news broke when reports surfaced that three major online poker companies, PokerStars, Full Tilt Poker, and Absolute Poker had been involved in a large-scale cheating operation.

The scam, which had been going on for years, involved players being able to see their opponents' hole cards - giving them a significant advantage in the game. This allowed the cheaters to win millions of dollars worth of prizes without ever having to risk their own money.

After the news broke, all three companies issued statements apologizing for their involvement in the scam and announcing that they were ceasing all operations indefinitely. The FBI also announced that they were launching an investigation into the matter.

This is by far the biggest online gambling scandal in history and it's sure to have a major impact on the industry as a whole.

#  Millions Lost in Illegal Online Gambling

Americans lost an estimated $4 billion to illegal online gambling in 2016, according to a report released Tuesday by the conservative National Center for Public Policy Research.

The report, which is based on figures from the Department of Justice, found that 96 percent of all online gambling revenue is generated illegally, through unlicensed and often overseas websites.

'This report underscores the urgent need for Congress to pass the Restoration of America’s Wire Act,' said Norm Singleton, president of the National Center for Public Policy Research.

The Restoration of America’s Wire Act (RAWA) is a bill that would prohibit most forms of online gambling and make it a felony to operate an unlicensed gambling website. The bill was introduced in the House of Representatives by Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) in March 2015 and has been endorsed by Sheldon Adelson, founder and CEO of Las Vegas Sands Corporation.

Adelson has long been a vocal opponent of online gambling, arguing that it is particularly susceptible to fraud and abuse. In testimony before Congress in 2013, he claimed that online gambling can be used to launder money and finance terrorism.

Online gambling proponents argue that such claims are overblown and that regulation would be more effective than prohibition in maintaining the safety and integrity of the industry. They also argue that banning online gambling would deprive states of important tax revenue.

A study commissioned by the pro-gambling group New Jersey’s Online Gaming Association estimated that if online gambling were legalized in New Jersey, it could generate up to $1 billion in new revenue for the state each year.

The RAWA bill has languished in Congress for two years, but with Adelson’s support it may be gaining new momentum. In October, Chaffetz convened a hearing on the RAWA bill before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.

#  International Crime Ring Busted for Online Gambling

A multinational crime ring that engaged in online gambling was recently busted by law enforcement authorities. The ring operated out of several countries, including the United States, China, and Thailand.

The ringleader, a man from the United States, is alleged to have made millions of dollars from the illegal gambling operation. He has been charged with racketeering and money laundering.

Authorities say that the ring was involved in a wide variety of online gambling activities, including sports betting, casino games, and poker. They also allege that the ring was responsible for laundering millions of dollars in illegal proceeds.

In addition to the ringleader, several other individuals have been arrested in connection with the gambling operation. They are all facing various criminal charges, including conspiracy and money laundering.

This case serves as a reminder that online gambling is illegal in many jurisdictions and can lead to serious criminal penalties.
