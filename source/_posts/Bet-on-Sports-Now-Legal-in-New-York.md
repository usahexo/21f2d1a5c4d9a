#  Bet on Sports Now Legal in New York

In May of 2018, New York legalized betting on sports. This was a monumental shift in legislation for the state, as well as for the rest of the United States. The reason that this is such a big deal is because up until this point, sports betting has been illegal in almost every state.

There are a few reasons why sports betting has been illegal in most states. The first reason is that there is a concern that the integrity of the sport could be compromised if people were able to bet on it. Another reason is that there is a concern that gambling addiction could lead to financial ruin for people.

Despite these concerns, there has been a growing push to legalize sports betting across the US. This is because it could generate a lot of revenue for states, as well as help to create jobs. It is also thought that legalizing sports betting could reduce crime rates, as people would have another legal way to gamble instead of turning to illegal methods.

So far, New York seems to be benefiting from legalizing sports betting. In the first month after it became legal, the state earned over $16 million in tax revenue from bets placed. This is just the beginning though, as the potential for profits from sports betting are huge. With more and more states likely to legalize it in the coming years, now is a good time to get into the sports betting market.

#  NY Gives Green Light to Sports Betting

In a major decision that could generate millions of dollars in revenue for the state, the New York Gaming Commission has voted to allow sports betting at up to four casinos.

The commission's 5-0 vote on Thursday opens the way for casinos in Albany, Schenectady, Buffalo and Yonkers to offer bets on professional and college sports, starting as early as next month.

According to The Associated Press, the move is expected to generate $100 million annually in tax revenue.

"We think this is an historic day," commission chairman Charlie Degliomini said after the vote. "This is an opportunity to keep people in New York state and gambling here rather than going across state lines."

Under the new regulations, casinos will be able to take bets on all major U.S. sports, including baseball, basketball, football and hockey. They will also be allowed to offer wagers on NASCAR, golf and other sporting events.

The commission said it would work with the state's Racing and Wagering Board to develop regulations governing sports betting, including minimum age requirements and limits on how much can be wagered.

It was not immediately clear how much revenue the casinos could expect to generate from sports betting. But experts told The AP that it could be substantial, given that more than $4 billion was bet on sports last year in New York alone through informal arrangements with bookmakers.

Casinos have been eager for years to get into the sports betting business, but were barred by federal law from doing so. That changed last year when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a federal ban on sports betting outside Nevada.

Since then, several states have moved to legalize sports betting, including Delaware, Mississippi and West Virginia.

#  New York Opens UpSports Betting Market

Last week, the Supreme Court overturned a 1992 federal law that had banned states from authorizing sports betting. The decision opens up what is expected to be a multibillion-dollar market and paves the way for states to legalize and regulate sports betting. New York was one of the most receptive states to the news, with lawmakers quickly moving to introduce legislation that would authorize sports betting within the state.

Supporters of legalized sports betting argue that it would generate new tax revenue for states and create jobs in the gaming industry. They also claim that it would help crack down on illegal sports betting, which is currently estimated to be a $150 billion industry.

Opponents of legalized sports betting argue that it could lead to increased gambling addiction and other social ills. They also worry that it could have a negative impact on professional and college sports, as teams could be more likely to “fix” games if there was widespread legal sports betting.

How New York Moves Forward

It remains to be seen how quickly New York will move forward in legalizing sports betting. Governor Andrew Cuomo has expressed support for the idea, but there may be some resistance in the state legislature. There are a number of different bills being proposed, all of which have different provisions. One bill would allow online and mobile betting, while another would restrict bets to physical locations such as casinos and race tracks.

One thing that is clear is that New York will not be waiting for the federal government to take action. The overturning of the 1992 law was largely due to a case brought by the state of New Jersey, which is now looking to ramp up its own efforts to legalize sports betting.

#  State of New York legalizes sports betting

The State of New York has legalized sports betting, becoming the fourth state in the US to do so after Delaware, Nevada, and Montana. The new law allows for bets on professional and collegiate sporting events, and will go into effect on August 1st.

Governor Andrew Cuomo outlined his reasoning in a statement, saying that legalizing sports betting would "generate hundreds of millions of dollars in new economic activity." He also argued that it would create jobs and help to fund education and infrastructure projects.

Opponents of the measure argue that it will lead to increased levels of gambling addiction, as well as other social ills. But Cuomo is confident that the benefits of legalization will outweigh any potential negatives.

Legalizing sports betting is seen as a major victory for the gambling industry, which has been pushing for such a move for years. The American Gaming Association (AGA) praised New York's decision, calling it "a watershed moment for the casino gaming industry."

The four states that have legalized sports betting represent just a fraction of the overall market; according to estimates, only about 10 percent of sports bets are placed legally. The rest take place illegally, often through offshore websites.

Experts say that the legalization of sports betting is inevitable, and that more states are likely to follow New York's lead in the near future. This could have a significant impact on the gambling industry, which is currently valued at around $240 billion.

#  Sports betting now legal in New York

After a long wait, sports betting is now legal in the state of New York. Governor Cuomo signed the legislation into law on Monday, and people can start placing bets at the state’s casinos and race tracks starting Wednesday.

“The excitement around sports gaming is palpable and I am proud that we are able to offer this opportunity to New Yorkers,” Governor Cuomo said in a statement.

There are some restrictions on who can bet: people must be 21 or older, and only those located in New York State can place bets.

But there’s a lot of potential for gambling in the state now that it’s officially legal. The NFL season is heating up, the NBA and NHL playoffs are just around the corner, and baseball is in full swing. There are also plenty of other sporting events throughout the year that could provide opportunities for gambling fans.

Not everyone is happy with the new law, though. Some lawmakers and advocates worry that it will lead to more gambling addiction problems in the state.

Governor Cuomo addressed those concerns, saying that “responsible gaming measures are included in this legislation to protect against abuse and address problem gambling.”

Sports betting has been illegal in New York since 1992, when then-Governor George Pataki signed a bill making it illegal. But attitudes have changed in recent years, with several states now legalizing sports betting.
