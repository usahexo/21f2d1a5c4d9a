#  One Person's Slot MLB Gamble Pays Off in Huge Way

It has been an interesting offseason for the MLB, with teams looking to make changes in order to get over the hump and into the playoffs. The San Francisco Giants were one of those teams, as they looked to fill their vacancy at first base.

Prior to the start of spring training, the Giants had signed former Kansas City Royals first baseman Brandon Moss to a minor league contract. This came as a bit of a surprise to many people, as Moss had been released by the Royals just days earlier.

Moss made the most of his opportunity with San Francisco, hitting .290 with six home runs and 20 RBI in 25 games this spring. Because of this strong showing, Moss was given the nod as the Giants' starting first baseman on opening day.

He has not disappointed since then, hitting safely in 12 of his first 13 games and raising his batting average up to .315. Most importantly, Moss has provided some power for the Giants, hitting six home runs in those 13 games.

This hot start is undoubtedly a surprise to many people, including Moss himself. In an interview with The Athletic's Andrew Baggarly, Moss said "I never would have thought I’d be here right now."

"I’ve gone through a lot of ups and downs in my career," continued Moss. "I always believed that I could still play and do some damage at this level."

Moss' gamble on himself has clearly paid off so far, and he will look to continue his hot streak going forward. The Giants currently sit at 7-6 and are just two games out of first place in the NL West.

#  One Person's Slot MLB Gamble Nets $100,000 Prize

In early 2017, one individual placed a bet on the winner of the World Series. That person risked $100 on the Houston Astros, and if they had won, they would have taken home a cool $100,000 prize. Unfortunately for them, the Los Angeles Dodgers ended up winning the series in seven games.

The person who placed the bet was not your average gambler - it was MLB commissioner Rob Manfred himself! He made the bet with Vegas bookmaker William Hill, and walked away with a nice profit despite his team losing.

It's not clear why Manfred decided to place this particular bet, but it's possible that he saw value in the Astros as underdog winners. In any event, it goes to show that even the most experienced gamblers can sometimes make mistakes - and that anyone has a chance at winning big money if they're willing to take a risk.

#  Single Slot MLB Bet Pays Out $10,000

If you are looking for a high-paying single slot bet in Major League Baseball, your best option is to wager on the Los Angeles Dodgers to win the World Series. The current odds at most sportsbooks have the Dodgers at 3/1, which means a $100 bet would pay out $300 if they win it all.

Looking for a team with value? The Washington Nationals (8/1) offer great odds relative to their talent level. If you’re feeling lucky, put some money on perennial underdog teams like the Oakland Athletics (50/1) or the Cincinnati Reds (100/1).

No matter which team you choose, make sure you are using a trusted and reliable sportsbook like Bovada. They offer competitive odds and a wide variety of betting options, so you can always find the right wager for your needs.

#  $10 Slot MLB Bet Turns into $1,000 Payday

It was a typical day at the ballpark. A friend and I were taking in a summer afternoon game between two neighboring teams. The weather was great, the company was good, and, of course, the beer was cold.

In the bottom of the seventh inning, with both teams’ pitchers tiring, we decided to make a small wager on the game. We each put $10 on the line to see who would win – our home team or their visitors.

The game went into extra innings and excitement built as the home team inched closer to victory. In the top of the 10th inning, with two runners on base and one out, their cleanup hitter came to bat. He hit a sharp ground ball right at our team’s shortstop. The shortstop quickly fielded the ball and threw it to first base…out!

We lost the bet. Our $10 had turned into a $1 payout.

Or so we thought….

A few weeks later, we received an unexpected email from our bookmaker. In it was a document showing that they had paid out not only our original $10 wager, but an additional $990 as well! Our $10 bet had turned into a $1,000 payday!

It turns out that one of our teams – the away team – had been heavily favored to win by most sportsbooks. Because of this, our bookmaker offered incredibly high odds on them winning outright (nearly 100-to-1). So even though we had technically lost our bet, since our home team didn’t win by enough for us to collect at those odds, our bookmaker paid us out anyway.

We were incredibly lucky that day at the ballpark. But whether you’re a seasoned sports bettor or just starting out, there are plenty of other great opportunities available to turn your $10 wager into a much bigger payday. Here are just a few examples:


# NBA Finals Game 7 Wager Turns Into $100K Payday 
A bettor who wagered $10 on the Golden State Warriors to beat the Cleveland Cavaliers in Game 7 of last year’s NBA Finals ended up winning nearly $100,000 thanks to some shrewd betting tactics. With Golden State trailing 3 games to 1 in the series, most sportsbooks were offering incredibly high odds on them coming back to win (some as high as 12-to-1), giving savvy gamblers like this one plenty of value if they chose to take advantage of it. 

# Liverpool vs Tottenham Hotspur Wager Turns Into £19K Payday   A Liverpool fan who placed a £10 bet on his team beating Tottenham Hotspur 2-1 in last year’s Champions League final ended up winning £19,000 after Liverpool came back from behind late in the game to pull off an improbable victory. This is another perfect example of how shrewd betting can result in some huge payouts even when your original wager is relatively small.

#  Small Slot MLB Bet Turns Into Large Payout

It's not every day that a small bet on a baseball game turns into a large payday, but that's exactly what happened for one lucky fan last weekend.

On Saturday, the Los Angeles Dodgers faced off against the Miami Marlins in a matchup that most fans would have deemed a lopsided contest. The Dodgers were heavily favored to win, and so it was no surprise when they took home the victory by a score of 7-1.

But for one bettor, that outcome spelled big profits. The fan had placed a small wager on the Dodgers to win - and because they did so convincingly, they earned a payout of nearly $1000.

It just goes to show that even when you're dealing with seemingly certainty, there's always the potential for an upset. So if you're feeling lucky, why not put down a couple of dollars on your favorite team? You might be pleasantly surprised come game day.
