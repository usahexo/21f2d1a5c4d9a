#  Edict Leaves Questions Unanswered About Jackpot Junction Casino




When the news of the $1.5 million dollar jackpot at Jackpot Junction Casino first broke, there was much speculation as to who the lucky winner might be. In the end, no one could have guessed that it would be a casino edict which announced the win. The lack of clarity in the wording of the edict has left many unanswered questions.

The edict, which was signed by casino owner John Haugen, read in part: “I, John Haugen, am the sole and exclusive owner of all rights in and to the $1.5 million jackpot won at Jackpot Junction Casino on October 3, 2016.” This declaration left many people scratching their heads because it is not clear how the casino owner can be both the sole and exclusive owner of the jackpot.

Haugen was asked to clarify his statement, but he declined to do so. It is unclear whether Haugen was trying to make a statement about his ownership of the casino or if he simply made a mistake in his wording. The ambiguity of the edict has led to a great deal of speculation, but no one seems to know what is really going on.

The only thing that is clear is that Haugen is not giving up his claim to the jackpot. He has stated that he will fight any legal challenges that might be brought against him and he is prepared to take this matter all the way to court. Whether or not he will be successful remains to be seen, but this issue is sure to generate a great deal of publicity for Jackpot Junction Casino.
