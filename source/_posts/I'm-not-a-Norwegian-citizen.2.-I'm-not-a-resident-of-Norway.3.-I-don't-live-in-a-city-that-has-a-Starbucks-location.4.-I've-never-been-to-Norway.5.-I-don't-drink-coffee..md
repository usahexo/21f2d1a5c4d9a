#  I'm not a Norwegian citizen.2. I'm not a resident of Norway.3. I don't live in a city that has a Starbucks location.4. I've never been to Norway.5. I don't drink coffee.

Despite all of that, I can tell you that Starbucks is not a good place to work.

I'm not going to sit here and try to convince you that Starbucks is a horrible company with terrible employees who don't care about their customers. I'm sure they have their share of great people working there. But, overall, I think it's a bad place to work.

Here are just a few reasons why:

1. The pay is low.

Unless you're a manager or some other high-level position, you're not going to make very much money at Starbucks. The starting wage is pretty low, and it only goes up a little bit with each level of experience.

2. The hours are unpredictable.

Starbucks notoriously has a very inconsistent schedule. You might be scheduled for 40 hours one week, and then only 20 hours the next week. This makes it difficult to plan anything else in your life outside of work.

3. The shifts are long.

Even if you do get scheduled for 40 hours per week, those hours will likely be spread out over five or six days instead of Monday through Friday. This means that you'll be working long shifts, often 10 or more hours per day.

4. There's no benefits package.

Unlike many other places where you can work, Starbucks doesn't offer any sort of benefits package. That means no health insurance, no retirement plan, and no paid vacation time.
