#  What are the controls?

The controls for a car are the devices that allow the driver to operate the vehicle. The most common controls are the steering wheel, the accelerator pedal, and the brake pedal. Other controls may include the gear shift, the turn signal lever, and the parking brake.

# The Steering Wheel

The steering wheel is one of the most important controls in a car. It allows the driver to steer the car in the desired direction. The wheel is typically located in the center of the dashboard and is mounted on a shaft that attaches to the car's steering system. The driver uses both hands to grip the wheel and turn it in the desired direction.

# The Accelerator Pedal

The accelerator pedal is used to control how fast a car travels. When pushed down, it increases the amount of gas being sent to the engine, which makes it speed up. When released, it slows down or stops the car. The accelerator pedal is located on the right side of the car, next to the brake pedal.

# The Brake Pedal

The brake pedal is used to slow or stop a car. When pressed down, it causes friction between brake pads and rotors to slow or stop motion. The brake pedal is located on the left side of a car, next to where you would put your left foot when driving.

#  How many different levels are there?

There are countless different levels of abstraction that a programmer can use when writing code. However, most programming languages can be classified into one of three categories: low-level, mid-level, or high-level.

Low-level programming languages are those that allow for close interaction with the computer's hardware. They include Assembly and C. Low-level programming languages are not easy to learn and are rarely used by beginners.

Mid-level programming languages are those that provide more structure than low-level languages but less than high-level languages. They include Pascal and C++. Mid-level programming languages are relatively easy to learn and are popular among beginners.

High-level programming languages are those that provide a high level of abstraction from the computer's hardware. They include Python and Ruby. High-level programming languages are easy to learn and popular among beginners and experienced programmers alike.

#  What kind of power-ups are available?

There are many power-ups in Mario Party: Star Rush, and they can be obtained by completing minigames or by opening chests. Each character has a unique set of power-ups, and the player can only use three at a time.

#  What sort of enemies will I be facing?

The enemies you face in <game> will be varied and interesting. From the lowly peasant, to the powerful noble, each opponent will pose a unique challenge. Each enemy has their own unique strengths and weaknesses that you'll need to exploit in order to emerge victorious. Learning about your enemy is essential to defeating them.

# The peasant

At the bottom of the food chain is the peasant. They're relatively weak, and lack any real form of defense. However, they can be dangerous in large numbers. Peasants typically attack with crude weapons, such as pitchforks or farm tools. They also have a tendency to throw objects at you, so keep your guard up.

# The noble

Above the peasants are the nobles. These are your typical swords and sorcery type enemies. They're well-armed and armored, and can deal a lot of damage if they manage to hit you. Nobles typically use swords and shields in battle, but some wield more exotic weapons such as maces or halberds. They're also proficient spellcasters, so watch out for spells like fireball or lightning bolt.
